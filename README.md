# catchphrase

### About
`catchphrase` is an open-source Android implementation of Hasbro's Catch Phrase game. It was originally written for a religious group to use during their game nights, but it can be adapted for other uses as well. It includes easy, medium, and hard levels, along with a secret easter egg level.

### How to play

1. When you start `catchphrase`, you'll be greeted with the main menu.

</p>

2. From the main menu, choose a level, then press Start to begin.

</p>

3. Once you begin, you'll see the timer start to tick down. Describe to your teammates the word you see on the screen. If they guess it right, click Correct and pass the app to the other team. If they can't guess it, click Skip to get a different word. If you need to end the round for any reason, click End Round.

</p>

4. When your teammates guess a word correctly, your team will earn a point. First team to 10 points wins!

### To-do
`catchphrase` isn't quite done yet. Here's what's left:
- The Settings page hasn't been implemented.
- Neither has the About popup. In addition to the standard info, it should also include attribution for licensed resources.
- The final app should include an interface in Settings to manage the word list.
- The names of the word list file and the easter egg level are still too specific to the original use case. The word list filename should be more generic, and the easter egg level should be editable in the app.
