# catchphrase

### About
`catchphrase` is an open-source Android implementation of Hasbro's Catch Phrase game. It was originally written for a religious group to use during their game nights, but it can be adapted for other uses as well. It includes easy, medium, and hard levels, along with a secret easter egg level.

### To-do
`catchphrase` still isn't quite done yet. Here's what's left:
- The Settings page isn't implemented.
- Neither is the About popup. In addition to the standard info, it should also include attribution for licensed resources.
- The final app should include an interface in Settings to manage the word list.
- The names of the word list file and the easter egg level are still too specific to the original use case. The word list filename should be more generic, and the easter egg level should be editable in the app.
